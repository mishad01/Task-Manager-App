But better late than never! I’m excited to finally share what I’ve been working on:
- REST API integration for seamless data management.
- GetX for efficient and powerful state management,navigation, and routing.
- Feature-based architecture that follows clean architecture principles. 
- A mix of tools and packages like shared preferences, image picker, and more, that brought the app to life and made it robust
